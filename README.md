# PoTGameMenu

The Simple 'Character' Object class works with 'PoTMenu' class to display a simple button click 
on the form for a label display of the player stats. 

The two additional methods in the 'Character' class are intended
for development in a later game scene/script and are generated for reference here. 

The 'Character p1 = new Character("01", "Bill gNant", 1, 1, true);' object instance
is a primitive example of the Object class working with the Menu class to display
a behavior. Or, in this case, to show the initial player stats.
